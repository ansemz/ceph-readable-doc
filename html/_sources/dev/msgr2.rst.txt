.. _msgr2-protocol:

msgr2 协议（ msgr2.0 和 msgr2.1 ）
==================================

老的 Ceph 底层协议是用 SimpleMessenger 实现的，这个协议是它的\
修订版，解决了性能和安全问题。


.. Goals

目标
----
与最初的协议相比，这个协议修订有几个目标：

* *Flexible handshaking*.  The original protocol did not have a
  sufficiently flexible protocol negotiation that allows for features
  that were not required.
* *Encryption*.  We will incorporate encryption over the wire.
* *Performance*.  We would like to provide for protocol features
  (e.g., padding) that keep computation and memory copies out of the
  fast path where possible.
* *Signing*.  We will allow for traffic to be signed (but not
  necessarily encrypted).  This may not be implemented in the initial version.


.. Definitions

定义
----

* *client* (C): the party initiating a (TCP) connection
* *server* (S): the party accepting a (TCP) connection
* *connection*: an instance of a (TCP) connection between two processes.
* *entity*: a ceph entity instantiation, e.g. 'osd.0'.  each entity
  has one or more unique entity_addr_t's by virtue of the 'nonce'
  field, which is typically a pid or random value.
* *session*: a stateful session between two entities in which message
  exchange is ordered and lossless.  A session might span multiple
  connections if there is an interruption (TCP connection disconnect).
* *frame*: a discrete message sent between the peers.  Each frame
  consists of a tag (type code), payload, and (if signing
  or encryption is enabled) some other fields.  See below for the
  structure.
* *tag*: a type code associated with a frame.  The tag
  determines the structure of the payload.

Phases
------

A connection has four distinct phases:

#. banner
#. authentication frame exchange
#. message flow handshake frame exchange
#. message frame exchange

Banner
------

Both the client and server, upon connecting, send a banner::

  "ceph %x %x\n", protocol_features_suppored, protocol_features_required

The protocol features are a new, distinct namespace.  Initially no
features are defined or required, so this will be "ceph 0 0\n".

If the remote party advertises required features we don't support, we
can disconnect.

                |                 |


.. Frame format

帧格式
------

After the banners are exchanged, all further communication happens
in frames.  The exact format of the frame depends on the connection
mode (msgr2.0-crc, msgr2.0-secure, msgr2.1-crc or msgr2.1-secure).
All connections start in crc mode (either msgr2.0-crc or msgr2.1-crc,
depending on peer_supported_features from the banner).

Each frame has a 32-byte preamble::

  __u8 tag
  __u8 number of segments
  {
    __le32 segment length
    __le16 segment alignment
  } * 4
  reserved (2 bytes)
  __le32 preamble crc

An empty frame has one empty segment.  A non-empty frame can have
between one and four segments, all segments except the last may be
empty.

If there are less than four segments, unused (trailing) segment
length and segment alignment fields are zeroed.

The reserved bytes are zeroed.

The preamble checksum is CRC32-C.  It covers everything up to
itself (28 bytes) and is calculated and verified irrespective of
the connection mode (i.e. even if the frame is encrypted).

### msgr2.0-crc mode

A msgr2.0-crc frame has the form::

  preamble (32 bytes)
  {
    segment payload
  } * number of segments
  epilogue (17 bytes)

where epilogue is::

  __u8 late_flags
  {
    __le32 segment crc
  } * 4

late_flags is used for frame abortion.  After transmitting the
preamble and the first segment, the sender can fill the remaining
segments with zeros and set a flag to indicate that the receiver must
drop the frame.  This allows the sender to avoid extra buffering
when a frame that is being put on the wire is revoked (i.e. yanked
out of the messenger): payload buffers can be unpinned and handed
back to the user immediately, without making a copy or blocking
until the whole frame is transmitted.  Currently this is used only
by the kernel client, see ceph_msg_revoke().

The segment checksum is CRC32-C.  For "used" empty segments, it is
set to (__le32)-1.  For unused (trailing) segments, it is zeroed.

The crcs are calculated just to protect against bit errors.
No authenticity guarantees are provided, unlike in msgr1 which
attempted to provide some authenticity guarantee by optionally
signing segment lengths and crcs with the session key.

Issues:

1. As part of introducing a structure for a generic frame with
   variable number of segments suitable for both control and
   message frames, msgr2.0 moved the crc of the first segment of
   the message frame (ceph_msg_header2) into the epilogue.

   As a result, ceph_msg_header2 can no longer be safely
   interpreted before the whole frame is read off the wire.
   This is a regression from msgr1, because in order to scatter
   the payload directly into user-provided buffers and thus avoid
   extra buffering and copying when receiving message frames,
   ceph_msg_header2 must be available in advance -- it stores
   the transaction id which the user buffers are keyed on.
   The implementation has to choose between forgoing this
   optimization or acting on an unverified segment.

2. late_flags is not covered by any crc.  Since it stores the
   abort flag, a single bit flip can result in a completed frame
   being dropped (causing the sender to hang waiting for a reply)
   or, worse, in an aborted frame with garbage segment payloads
   being dispatched.

   This was the case with msgr1 and got carried over to msgr2.0.

### msgr2.1-crc mode

Differences from msgr2.0-crc:

1. The crc of the first segment is stored at the end of the
   first segment, not in the epilogue.  The epilogue stores up to
   three crcs, not up to four.

   If the first segment is empty, (__le32)-1 crc is not generated.

2. The epilogue is generated only if the frame has more than one
   segment (i.e. at least one of second to fourth segments is not
   empty).  Rationale: If the frame has only one segment, it cannot
   be aborted and there are no crcs to store in the epilogue.

3. Unchecksummed late_flags is replaced with late_status which
   builds in bit error detection by using a 4-bit nibble per flag
   and two code words that are Hamming Distance = 4 apart (and not
   all zeros or ones).  This comes at the expense of having only
   one reserved flag, of course.

Some example frames:

* A 0+0+0+0 frame (empty, no epilogue)::

    preamble (32 bytes)

* A 20+0+0+0 frame (no epilogue)::

    preamble (32 bytes)
    segment1 payload (20 bytes)
    __le32 segment1 crc

* A 0+70+0+0 frame::

    preamble (32 bytes)
    segment2 payload (70 bytes)
    epilogue (13 bytes)

* A 20+70+0+350 frame::

    preamble (32 bytes)
    segment1 payload (20 bytes)
    __le32 segment1 crc
    segment2 payload (70 bytes)
    segment4 payload (350 bytes)
    epilogue (13 bytes)

where epilogue is::

  __u8 late_status
  {
    __le32 segment crc
  } * 3


Hello
-----

* TAG_HELLO: client->server and server->client::

    __u8 entity_type
    entity_addr_t peer_socket_address

  - We immediately share our entity type and the address of the peer (which can be useful
    for detecting our effective IP address, especially in the presence of NAT).


Authentication
--------------

* TAG_AUTH_REQUEST: client->server::

    __le32 method;  // CEPH_AUTH_{NONE, CEPHX, ...}
    __le32 num_preferred_modes;
    list<__le32> mode  // CEPH_CON_MODE_*
    method specific payload

* TAG_AUTH_BAD_METHOD server -> client: reject client-selected auth method::

    __le32 method
    __le32 negative error result code
    __le32 num_methods
    list<__le32> allowed_methods // CEPH_AUTH_{NONE, CEPHX, ...}
    __le32 num_modes
    list<__le32> allowed_modes   // CEPH_CON_MODE_*

  - Returns the attempted auth method, and error code (-EOPNOTSUPP if
    the method is unsupported), and the list of allowed authentication
    methods.

* TAG_AUTH_REPLY_MORE: server->client::

    __le32 len;
    method specific payload

* TAG_AUTH_REQUEST_MORE: client->server::

    __le32 len;
    method specific payload

* TAG_AUTH_DONE: (server->client)::

    __le64 global_id
    __le32 connection mode // CEPH_CON_MODE_*
    method specific payload

  - The server is the one to decide authentication has completed and what
    the final connection mode will be.


Example of authentication phase interaction when the client uses an
allowed authentication method:

.. ditaa::

           +---------+        +--------+
           | Client  |        | Server |
           +---------+        +--------+
                | auth request    |
                |---------------->|
                |<----------------|
                |        auth more|
                |                 |
                |auth more        |
                |---------------->|
                |<----------------|
                |        auth done|


Example of authentication phase interaction when the client uses a forbidden
authentication method as the first attempt:

.. ditaa::

           +---------+        +--------+
           | Client  |        | Server |
           +---------+        +--------+
                | auth request    |
                |---------------->|
                |<----------------|
                |   bad method    |
                |                 |
                | auth request    |
                |---------------->|
                |<----------------|
                |        auth more|
                |                 |
                | auth more       |
                |---------------->|
                |<----------------|
                |        auth done|


Post-auth frame format
----------------------

The frame format is fixed (see above), but can take three different
forms, depending on the AUTH_DONE flags:

* If neither FLAG_SIGNED or FLAG_ENCRYPTED is specified, things are simple::

    frame_len
    tag
    payload
    payload_padding (out to auth block_size)

  - The padding is some number of bytes < the auth block_size that
    brings the total length of the payload + payload_padding to a
    multiple of block_size.  It does not include the frame_len or tag.  Padding
    content can be zeros or (better) random bytes.

* If FLAG_SIGNED has been specified::

    frame_len
    tag
    payload
    payload_padding (out to auth block_size)
    signature (sig_size bytes)

  Here the padding just makes life easier for the signature.  It can be
  random data to add additional confounder.  Note also that the
  signature input must include some state from the session key and the
  previous message.

* If FLAG_ENCRYPTED has been specified::

    frame_len
    tag
    {
      payload
      payload_padding (out to auth block_size)
    } ^ stream cipher

  Note that the padding ensures that the total frame is a multiple of
  the auth method's block_size so that the message can be sent out over
  the wire without waiting for the next frame in the stream.


Message flow handshake
----------------------

In this phase the peers identify each other and (if desired) reconnect to
an established session.

* TAG_CLIENT_IDENT (client->server): identify ourselves::

    __le32 num_addrs
    entity_addrvec_t*num_addrs entity addrs
    entity_addr_t target entity addr
    __le64 gid (numeric part of osd.0, client.123456, ...)
    __le64 global_seq
    __le64 features supported (CEPH_FEATURE_* bitmask)
    __le64 features required (CEPH_FEATURE_* bitmask)
    __le64 flags (CEPH_MSG_CONNECT_* bitmask)
    __le64 cookie

  - client will send first, server will reply with same.  if this is a
    new session, the client and server can proceed to the message exchange.
  - the target addr is who the client is trying to connect *to*, so
    that the server side can close the connection if the client is
    talking to the wrong daemon.
  - type.gid (entity_name_t) is set here, by combinging the type shared in the hello
    frame with the gid here.  this means we don't need it
    in the header of every message.  it also means that we can't send
    messages "from" other entity_name_t's.  the current
    implementations set this at the top of _send_message etc so this
    shouldn't break any existing functionality.  implementation will
    likely want to mask this against what the authenticated credential
    allows.
  - cookie is the client coookie used to identify a session, and can be used
    to reconnect to an existing session.
  - we've dropped the 'protocol_version' field from msgr1

* TAG_IDENT_MISSING_FEATURES (server->client): complain about a TAG_IDENT
  with too few features::

    __le64 features we require that the peer didn't advertise

* TAG_SERVER_IDENT (server->client): accept client ident and identify server::

    __le32 num_addrs
    entity_addrvec_t*num_addrs entity addrs
    __le64 gid (numeric part of osd.0, client.123456, ...)
    __le64 global_seq
    __le64 features supported (CEPH_FEATURE_* bitmask)
    __le64 features required (CEPH_FEATURE_* bitmask)
    __le64 flags (CEPH_MSG_CONNECT_* bitmask)
    __le64 cookie

  - The server cookie can be used by the client if it is later disconnected
    and wants to reconnect and resume the session.

* TAG_RECONNECT (client->server): reconnect to an established session::

    __le32 num_addrs
    entity_addr_t * num_addrs
    __le64 client_cookie
    __le64 server_cookie
    __le64 global_seq
    __le64 connect_seq
    __le64 msg_seq (the last msg seq received)

* TAG_RECONNECT_OK (server->client): acknowledge a reconnect attempt::

    __le64 msg_seq (last msg seq received)

  - once the client receives this, the client can proceed to message exchange.
  - once the server sends this, the server can proceed to message exchange.

* TAG_RECONNECT_RETRY_SESSION (server only): fail reconnect due to stale connect_seq

* TAG_RECONNECT_RETRY_GLOBAL (server only): fail reconnect due to stale global_seq

* TAG_RECONNECT_WAIT (server only): fail reconnect due to connect race.

  - Indicates that the server is already connecting to the client, and
    that direction should win the race.  The client should wait for that
    connection to complete.

* TAG_RESET_SESSION (server only): ask client to reset session::

      __u8 full

  - full flag indicates whether peer should do a full reset, i.e., drop
    message queue.


Example of failure scenarios:

* First client's client_ident message is lost, and then client reconnects.

Message exchange

Once a session is established, we can exchange messages.

* TAG_MSG: a message::

    middle
    data_pre_padding
    data

  - The ceph_msg_header2 is modified from ceph_msg_header:
      * include an ack_seq.  This avoids the need for a TAG_ACK
        message most of the time.
      * remove the src field, which we now get from the message flow
        handshake (TAG_IDENT).
      * specifies the data_pre_padding length, which can be used to
        adjust the alignment of the data payload.  (NOTE: is this is
        useful?)

* TAG_ACK: acknowledge receipt of message(s)::

    __le64 seq

  - This is only used for stateful sessions.

* TAG_KEEPALIVE2: check for connection liveness::

    ceph_timespec stamp

  - Time stamp is local to sender.

* TAG_KEEPALIVE2_ACK: reply to a keepalive2::

    ceph_timestamp stamp

  - Time stamp is from the TAG_KEEPALIVE2 we are responding to.

* TAG_CLOSE: terminate a connection

  Indicates that a connection should be terminated. This is equivalent
  to a hangup or reset (i.e., should trigger ms_handle_reset).  It
  isn't strictly necessary or useful as we could just disconnect the
  TCP connection.
